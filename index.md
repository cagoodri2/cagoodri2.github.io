## Data Science Portfolio ##

This github is updated regularly with additional work - check back to see what else I have been up to! 

The project title connects to a executive summary of the work completed, as well as sample code for the project. The programming language used & highlighted libraries or packages are italicized below. 

### Completed Projects ###

__[Time Series Analysis - Cardiac Hospital Admissions](./content/tsa_cardiac.html)__

> ARIMA, Auto.Arima, Lagged Auto.Arima & Vector Auto Regression were utilized to explore heart failure, shock and mean length of stay in a time series dataset of daily hospital admissions at Hero DMC Heart institute.

Language: R  

Libraries: lubridate, ggplot2, forecast, tseries, TSA, tidyr, dplyr

__[Reccurrent Neural Networks - LSST Classification](./content/rnn_lsst.html)__

> A hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was iteratively developed and trained to predict target variables from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) dataset. The LSST dataset is a time series dataset containing light curve measurements for different astronomical objects.

Language: Python

Packages: numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras_tuner, imblearn, matplotlib, seaborn

__[Machine Learning - Meteor Type Prediction](./content/ml_meteor.html)__

> KNN, KNN with GridSearchCV, Adaboost, Adaboost with GridSearchCV, Random Forest, Random Forest with GridSearch CV were used to classify target variable ('meteor types') in unbalanced dataset with limited features. Data was sourced from NASA.

Language: Python 

Packages: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Current Projects ##

Current projects do not have a summary page or sample code currently - either due to data use agreements, submission processes or stage of project. These projects are included to highlight my current interests.

__Machine Learning - Predictors of Stress Among Fox Insight Participants__

As a continuation of my work as a DREAM Data Science Graduate Apprentice, I am in the manuscript submission phase for this project. Logistic Regression, Decision Tress & Adaboost models were applied and optimized in python on real world longitudinal health data to examine the predictors of stress among participants with Parkinson's Diease (PD) vs. those without. 

__NLP - Sentiment Analysis & Public Perceptions of Vaccines__

Using sentiment analysis, I hope to gain an understanding of how public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines shifted (or didn't) over the course of the pandemic. This exploration is in the early phases. I am particularly interested in public understand of mRNA's function within the vaccine.
