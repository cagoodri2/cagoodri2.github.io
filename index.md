## Highlighted Portfolio Projects ## 

__[Time Series Analysis - Cardiac Hospital Admissions](./tsa_cardiac.html)__

> ARIMA, Auto.Arima, Lagged Auto.Arima & Vector Auto Regression were utilized to explore three common measures of illness severity - heart failure, shock and mean length of stay - in a time series dataset of daily hospital admissions at Hero DMC Heart institute.

_Language & Libraries:_ R | Needed

## Additional Work ##

__[Machine Learning - Meteor Type Prediction](./ml_meteor.html)__

> KNN, KNN with GridSearchCV, Adaboost, Adaboost with GridSearchCV, Random Forest, Random Forest with GridSearch CV were used to classify target variable ('meteor types') in unbalanced dataset with limited features. Data was sourced from NASA.

_Language & Packages:_ Python | Needed 

__[Machine Learning - Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction](./ml_diabetes.html)__

>Guassian Naive Bayes were applied using 10-fold cross validation with tuning of variable smoothing to predict diabetes diagnosis. Three versions of the dataset were utilized to improve model accuracy: base dataset, normalized dataset, and a reduced features dataset. Exploratory analysis includes a brief comparison of common features between the Pima Indian population & the national population.
